## Branches

Please do not work directly on Master for development. Instead, create your own branch! Its not difficult. 

1. Start with master $ git checkout master
2. Make sure its up to date $ git pull origin master
3. Branch off $ git checkout -b [YOUR-BRANCH-NAME[
4. Do all your work on your branch
5. When your ready to go back to master first pull in all the changes done on master since you left $ git merge master
6. Once you've resolve any issues brining master work to your branch, submit a pull request on Github
